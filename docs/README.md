### Introducing Volatco

**Volatco - The Ultra‑Compact, Low‑Power AI Engine for Researchers, Makers, and Edge‑Computing Pioneers**

**Why Volatco?**

Artificial‑intelligence research is no longer confined to massive datacenter farms. To explore **embodied AI, neuromorphic experimentation, and ultra‑low‑energy inference**, we need hardware that is **massively parallel, energy‑frugal, and easily extensible**.

The **Volatco prototype**, engineered by **Cartheur Research**, delivers exactly that. It packs **two GA144 mesh‑processor chips**, **2 MB of SRAM**, **16 MB of SPI flash**, and a flexible off‑board I/O architecture into a board **smaller than a credit card** that draws **only milliwatts of power when idle**.

**Accessories:** Dedicated power, Ethernet, BLE: Volatco has them!

**polyForth:** On-board operating system that is lightweight, dual-stack operating system and programming environment.

**Bottom line:** Volatco gives you a full‑blown AI compute node for **€495 per board**-transparent, open‑hardware pricing with no hidden markup.

**Key Features**

| **Feature** | **Benefit** |
| --- | --- |
| **Dual GA144 Cores (144 × 2 = 288 cores)** | Run 288 concurrent threads -ideal for parallel algorithms, machine-intelligence, and evolutionary computing. |
| **PolyFORTH® Runtime** | A lightweight, stack‑based language that lets you prototype, debug, and iterate on AI kernels in minutes-no heavyweight SDKs required. |
| **2 MB SRAM + 16 MB SPI Flash** | Fast volatile memory for model parameters and large non‑volatile storage for firmware, datasets, and compiled Forth programs. |
| **Zero On‑Board Regulation** | Power is supplied externally, eliminating regulator quiescent draw and shrinking the PCB. Choose the most efficient supply for your experiment. |
| **Rich Off‑Board I/O (0.1″ Headers)** | All GPIO, analogue‑in/out, and power pins are exposed on a standard breadboard‑compatible header. Plug in sensors, actuators, or custom expansion boards without soldering. |
| **Watchdog & Reset Circuitry** | Automatic recovery from software hangs, essential for long‑running experiments. |
| **Modular Expansion Row** | Connect external power modules, additional memory, Bluetooth, Ethernet, or bespoke I/O boards via header rows. |
| **Compact Form Factor** | Designed to fit into tight enclosures, drone payload bays, or multi‑board racks for scalable clusters. |

**Who Is Volatco For?**

- **Academic & industry researchers** exploring new AI architectures, spiking networks, or energy‑aware machine learning.
- **Hardware hackers & makers** who want a hands‑on platform for autonomous robots, sensor‑fusion nodes, or edge‑AI devices.
- **Educators & students** seeking a tangible, low‑cost system to teach parallel computing and low‑power design principles.
- **Start‑ups & prototypers** needing a ready‑made, asynchronous AI engine that can be integrated into products without additional licensing fees.

**Our Vision**

To **democratize high‑performance, energy‑efficient machine intelligence**. By bringing Volatco to the community, we'll create an ecosystem of **open‑source tools, asynchronous multicomputing, and collaborative research**-all built around a board anyone can afford and modify on an individual scale.
